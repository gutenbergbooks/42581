<p><b>Wheeler.</b> (<i>reading</i>) Last evening a bold and daring robbery was
committed at the residence of Mrs. Thornton. While she was
serving her guests with refreshments, some one entered her
dressing-room and removed from her jewel-case diamonds valued
at a fabulous price, leaving in exchange perfect specimens of
worthless glass imitations. Suspicion points strongly to George
Graef, her nephew, as the guilty party. He was seen to enter
Davis's pawn shop late last night, after the guests had left his
aunt's residence, and pawn something. One of the diamonds
was recovered this morning from Davis's store, but he professed
ignorance as to the name of the man who left it. Young Graef,
though he strongly denies committing the theft, was compelled
to leave his aunt's residence this morning. He has been very
dissipated of late, drinking and gambling to excess, and it is
thought that financial embarrassment tempted him to commit
the crime. (<i>lays paper on table</i>) Poor fellow! What an inglorious
ending for what <i>might</i> have been a brilliant career. <i>Gilded
youth</i>, like the rest of common humanity, when it enters the arena
against the sparkling cup, witty companions and fascinating
games of chance, must finally succumb.</p>

<p class="sd center">Enter <i><span class="smcap">Pete</span>, <span class="allsc">L. U. E.</span>; passes through gate</i>.
</p>

<p><b>Pete.</b> (<i>bowing</i>) Massa Wheeler, missus sends her best 'spects,
an' quests de delight ob yo'r pleasure to dinner, sah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Requests the pleasure of my <i>company</i>, I suppose you
mean.</p>

<p><b>Pete.</b> Yes, sah, I 'spects dat's what she meant. (<i>aside</i>) One nebber
knows what dese wimmin folks mean by what dey says, no-how.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> At what time do you dine?</p>

<p><b>Pete.</b> (<i>looking at <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span> a moment</i>) Sah?</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> At what time do you eat dinner?</p>

<p><b>Pete.</b> When de rest git froo.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> What time do the rest usually "get through?"</p>

<p><b>Pete.</b> I dunno. (<i>laughs</i>) Guess when dey gits tired ob eatin'.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> You impertinent black rascal! What do you mean
by answering me in that manner?</p>

<p><b>Pete.</b> (<i>aside</i>) By golly, he's mad already! (<i>aloud</i>) Massa
Wheeler, yo' knows jest as well as I do dat I was not sassin'
yo'. Yo' axes me at what time I eats, an' I tole yo'. Yo' don't
s'pose I eats wid de <i>quality</i> folks, does yo'?</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> I'd not be the least bit surprised if they were to allow
you. You have never been taught your true position, nor
how to address a gentleman.</p>

<p><b>Pete.</b> I 'spects I knows how to 'dress dem when I meets 'em.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> (<i>angrily</i>) What's that?</p>

<p><b>Pete.</b> Massa Wheeler, it 'pears mighty queer dat yo' an' I can't
talk sociably for five minnits widout quarrelin'. I'se agwine to
tell missus dat de next time she wants a note sent to you, dat
she will hab to seek some oder 'vayance, for I won't take it,
suah.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> So Mrs. Thornton sent me a note, did she?</p>

<p><b>Pete.</b> Ob course she did.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Where is it?</p>

<p><b>Pete.</b> In my pocket.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Why did you not give it to me then, instead of attempting
to deliver her message verbally?</p>

<p><b>Pete.</b> Kase yo' nebber axed me for it.</p>

<p class="sd center">Enter <i><span class="smcap">Graef</span>, <span class="allsc">R. U. E.</span>; passes through gate and goes down <span class="allsc">C.</span></i>
</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> (<i>advances and playfully slaps <span class="smcap">Graef</span> on left shoulder</i>)
Graef, old boy, how are you? I was just thinking about you, and
regretting that you had got yourself into trouble.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> To what do you refer?</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> (<i>lightly</i>) To that little affair at your aunt's house last
night.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> Then you have heard about it?</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Why, of course.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> From whom?</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> I saw a little account of it in this morning's issue
(<i>pointing to paper on table</i>) of the <i>Sun</i>.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> (<i>surprised</i>) What! Has it already appeared in print?
(<i>picks up paper and reads to himself while <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span> is talking</i>)</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Yes, but you need not mind that. All you have to do
is to leave town for a few years. Go to some place where you are
unknown, carve out a name and fortune for yourself, return here
<i>wealthy</i>, and this trivial offence of yours will be condoned, at
least, if you are not made a hero of.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> (<i>excitedly, pointing to passage in article</i>) That's not true.
I was not "compelled to leave my aunt's residence." I left of my
own free will. I could not remain there after I knew she
thought I had committed the deed.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> (<i>soothingly</i>) Of course not; never mind that article,
it's not of much importance. No one believes sensational newspaper
reports, anyhow.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> But that does me a gross injustice.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Oh, pshaw, that's nothing. Let it go, and forget all
about it. What do you intend doing with yourself now?</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> I intend to remain here, turn over a new leaf, make a man
of myself, and live down this disgrace.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> (<i>coolly</i>) Better not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Because you will not find it a comfortable existence.
Persons who know you well, like myself, would pay no attention
to the charge preferred against you, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> Well?</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> There are plenty of others who would, and your daily
life would be beset by the harassing knowledge of being surrounded
by those who doubted your honesty.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> Let them doubt me if they will. The peace and tranquility
that innocence imparts to me will more than over-balance that.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Have it as you will. But if you were to follow the advice
of a friend, you would do as I suggested, leave this town and
that instantly.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> (<i>suspiciously</i>) You appear anxious to have me go.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Oh, no; not anxious in the sense you mean. I only
wish to save you and your friends unnecessary pain. If you are
short of funds, say so and I will advance you any reasonable sum
you may require.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> (<i>coldly</i>) Thank you. I did not come here to beg assistance.
I merely stopped to tell you that under existing circumstances
you will have to select some other groomsman; I cannot
officiate.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> I'm sorry, but as to selecting another, that's out of the
question. It's too late. If you remain in town I presume you
will be present at our marriage.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> No, that's impossible! (<i>going</i>)</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> It's too bad, old boy; but keep up your spirits. You
had better think over my suggestion.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> (<i>at gate</i>) Once for all, Wheeler, I tell you, I'll never do
it. I'm no coward. Here in this town I was born and raised, and
<i>here</i> I'll remain and redeem my character. I'll either live down
the stigma attached to it, or die in the attempt.

must, or I'll ruin him body and soul. I know his weaknesses, and
I'll play upon them until he accomplishes my purpose. (<i>bitterly</i>)
Oh, to get even with her father and relations has been my prayer
for years. (<i>goes to table <span class="allsc">L.</span>, and sits; picks up paper and pretends to

<p><b>Daisy.</b> No, sir, but I could not come any earlier, and I can only
stay a moment now. We are very busy at home preparing for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Deacon's arrival. You know Mrs. Thornton expects him to-day.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Yes, I was aware of it. How does Mrs. Thornton
stand her loss?</p>

<p><b>Daisy.</b> Oh, she feels terribly about it, sir. She has forbidden
Miss Helen, Pete and all of us ever to mention the subject to her.
Just to think that Mr. George should be guilty of such a thing!
But then I don't believe he did do it!</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> (<i>affecting surprise</i>) Don't you? Well, I wish I could
think so, too. You know he has been very wild of late.</p>

<p><b>Daisy.</b> I know he has; but Mr. George would never do a mean
thing like that.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> (<i>doubtingly</i>) I don't know.</p>

<p><b>Daisy.</b> (<i>warmly</i>) Well, I do. But I must be going. What did
you wish to see me about, sir?</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Did you find a watch charm or note anywhere in your
house this morning?</p>

<p><b>Daisy.</b> No, sir.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> I lost them somewhere last night, and I'm pretty sure
it was in your house. They are of no use to anybody but me. I
prize the charm solely because it was a present from my mother,
and the note accompanied it. Now if you find them and return
them to me as soon as you possibly can, I'll make you a present
of a ten-dollar bill.</p>

<p><b>Daisy.</b> Oh, thank you, sir. I'll try my best to find them. Is
that all? I must hurry back home again.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Yes, I believe so.</p>

<p><b>Daisy.</b> Be careful when you see Mrs. Thornton and don't say
anything to her about her loss or Mr. George. Good morning,
sir.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> All right, I won't. Good morning. (Exit <i><span class="smcap">Daisy</span>, gate

ten dollars she ever earned. But suppose it proves fruitless!
What then? I should be placed in a very unpleasant position.
(<i>thinks</i>) Ah, well, it's time to worry when trouble overtakes one.
I've often been more sorely pressed than I shall be by this little
affair, and come out all right; and I guess I can do it again if the

We missed the early stage, so there was no one to meet him. I
directed him here for information as to Mrs. Thornton's residence.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Did you ride over with him in the stage?</p>

<p><b>Read.</b> Yes, there was no one in the stage with us except the
Deacon's boy, Billy.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> (<i>disappointed</i>) Has he a boy with him? That's bad.</p>

<p><b>Read.</b> Yes, a dull, ignorant, country lout. But he'll not interfere
with your plans, for I sent him around the square, and some
of the boys will be sure to detain him and have some fun with
him.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Did you have any trouble in getting the Deacon to try
your lemonade?</p>

<p><b>Read.</b> (<i>laughing</i>) Not a particle. He complained about the heat
and the jostling of the stage making him feel sick and giddy; so
I pulled out my flask, told him I was subject to just such attacks
while travelling, and that I always went prepared for such emergencies,
etc. After I assured him that the flask contained nothing
but weak lemonade and a harmless ingredient to give it its peculiar
color, he nearly emptied it for me.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Did you mix your lemonade according to my directions?</p>

<p><b>Read.</b> Yes, and if he is not jolly blind drunk inside of a half
hour, then I don't know my man. His tongue was beginning to
wag when I left him. But I must be off, for the Deacon is nearly
here. (<i>starts to go, but stops near <span class="allsc">L. U. E.</span> as <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span> speaks</i>)</p>

<p><b>Read.</b> You forget that Walters has not returned from&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Hush! Confound it, that's true. It takes him an
eternity to do the simplest thing. Never mind, I'll attend to it myself.
Get off with you now, quick. (Exit <i><span class="smcap">Read</span>, <span class="allsc">L. U. E.</span> <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>

never met Mrs. Thornton. She's my sister-in-law. My brother
Bill and I had a fall-out when we were young, and never made up
afterward. She's Bill's widow. Helen's her daughter, my niece.

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Yes, it is warm. (<i>rising</i>) Excuse me, but I never

you.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. T.</b> (<i>firmly</i>) Just as soon as you answer the bell, go to your

comply with your request.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Mrs. T.</b> I do hope that was brother ringing. Do you know, I
feel no little anxiety about this meeting.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> I think your daughter told me that you never had met
your brother-in-law?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. T.</b> No; William, my late husband, and he were not good
friends. It was the Deacon's fault. In his younger days he was
too fond of the wine cup, and when William attempted to warn
him of its evils, he became angry, alienated himself from my husband,
and refused from that day on to have any intercourse with
him whatever.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> I think I have heard it mentioned somewhere that he
is still a little too fond of the cup at times.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. T.</b> Yes, I am sorry to say that the habit contracted in
youth still clings to him. That is usually the case. But it is only
on very rare occasions that he imbibes too much. I believe he is
conscientious and tries to do what is right. I do hope and pray
that he will not consider this a <i>rare</i> occasion, and may remain
sober during his stay with us.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> It is to be <i>sincerely</i> hoped so.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. T.</b> This visit of his is due entirely to the exertions of my
sister Amelia. She met him last year while visiting a friend of hers
residing in his neighborhood. A sort of mutual attachment sprang
up between them. Where it will end goodness only knows. I fear
Amelia is very much in love with him.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Indeed!</p>

<p><b>Mrs. T.</b> Yes, hence my anxiety that our meeting may prove a
pleasant one.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> The Deacon is not a bachelor, is he?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. T.</b> Oh, no. He lost his wife some thirty years ago.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Has he no children?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. T.</b> Only one daughter. But never refer to her in his presence.
He has disowned her. She married against his wishes, and
a miserable life she has led. The Deacon is very self-willed,
stubborn and self-opinionated, and will listen to no reason when it
clashes against his set views.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> But, surely if one were to represent to him that his
daughter was suffering and needy, he would not refuse to aid her.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. T.</b> He would, as sure as you are living. Oh, Mr. Wheeler,
I know the nobility of your character, how anxious you are to aid
suffering humanity; but let me beseech you, as you value Helen's
peace of mind and mine, <i>never</i> refer to the Deacon's daughter in
his presence unless you desire to bring on a storm.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Mrs. T.</b> Hush, I hear him coming. (<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> and <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> (<i>evasively</i>) What brought you here?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> The desire to find you&mdash;to be with my husband.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> (<i>coldly</i>) Now that you have found him, what do you
propose doing?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> Staying with him and fulfilling my wifely vows.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> (<i>vexed</i>) I thought we had parted never to meet
again.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> (<i>astonished</i>) Why, George, what have I done to merit

Heaven's name, speak! (<i><span class="smcap">Wheeler</span> hesitates</i>) Tell me, or my
heart will break. (<i>places hand affectionately upon <span class="smcap">Wheeler's</span>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> (<i>removing her hand</i>) Upon your own head be the
consequences of your rash request. (<i>speaks vehemently</i>) You have
destroyed every vestige of manliness in my character; you have
changed my nature and caused me to become a gambler, a thief
and a blackleg; with your artful smile you cajoled me into marrying
you; taught me to loathe myself, shun society, and spurn my
<i>true</i> friends&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> George!</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> You drove me from home, by convincing me that I
did not love you, into scenes of revolting crime and iniquity; and
now, after a lapse of over two years&mdash;spent in the prostitution of
the nobler traits of my character, at the gaming table, in drinking
revelries and in fast society&mdash;just as the sun is beginning to shed
its rays upon a pathway leading to my reclamation, you&mdash;<i>you</i>, who
have been the bane of my life, cross it, and your fitful shadow
hisses in my ear, "stop, or I'll destroy you."</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> George, let me beseech you to desist. What demon
possesses you thus to accuse me, who am innocent of ever having
injured you by word, thought or deed. Oh, George, I love you
too dearly to believe that you mean the bitter things you have just
uttered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> But I do mean them. You alone are responsible for
the hatred I bear you.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> Hate me! I, who sacrificed home, friends, wealth, position
and parent for you! (<i>places hand upon shoulder</i>) Am I
awake, or is this some frightful hallucination? I cannot believe it.
George, husband, father of my child, in mercy's name recall
your cruel words!</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> They are too true. I cannot.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> Then you no longer love me?</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> You force me to say it&mdash;I do not.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> Heaven help me then, and protect a discarded wife and
fatherless child.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Minnie, the sooner this harassing interview is over the
better it will be for both.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> Yes, no doubt of it. I came searching for my lost husband,
loving and trusting in him. I have found him, 'tis true, but
false to his marriage vows, and doubly false to the common ties of
humanity.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Once more, Minnie, let me urge upon you to end this
scene. What are your plans for the future?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> I have none. The God of the fatherless must now direct
my steps. (<i>appears stupefied</i>)</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Listen to me then. If you promise to leave this place
and never place foot in it again, I will deposit with McGrath, the
banker, a sum of money sufficient to support you and Nellie the
remainder of your lives.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> Then this is to be our last meeting as man and wife?</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> (<i>ill at ease</i>) It is&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> And thus you ignore your marriage vow to "love, honor
and protect" me?</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> If you are not satisfied, you have the courts to seek
for redress&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> In what manner?</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> By applying for a divorce.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> A divorce?</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> Then you <i>are</i> in earnest?</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Was never more so in my life. As a proof of it (<i>takes
pocket-book from pocket, and quickly selecting a couple of notes, tenders
them to <span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span></i>) there is sufficient means to obtain shelter for
yourself this night, and to carry you back to your former home in
the morning.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> (<i>haughtily spurns it</i>) Keep your money! I'll never
touch a cent of your ill-gotten wealth. For two long years have I
supported myself and my child without assistance from you, and
Heaven helping me, I will continue to do so for the future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Very well, let it be as you please. (<i>replaces money</i>) As

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> (<i>pleadingly</i>) George, is there nothing I can do to regain

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Merely wish to sever the bonds connecting us, and
the sooner you leave this place the better I'll be pleased.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> Apologies are unnecessary, madam. I am only too happy
to place my humble room at your disposal. (<i>Places chair <span class="allsc">C.</span> near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>

<p><b>Graef.</b> (<i>eagerly</i>) Don't you know me?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> (<i>coldly, shrinking away from him</i>) No, sir, I think you

<p><b>Graef.</b> Why, I'm George Graef.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> (<i>joyously</i>) My cousin&mdash;the one who played with me in
my girlish days?</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> None other. (<i>they shake hands</i>) How happy I am to see
you.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> Strange that I did not recognize you at first.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> Stranger it is that I should be so blind; for you have
changed but little since I last saw you&mdash;some eight years ago.</p>

<p><b>Pete.</b> By jiminy crickitees! She's some relation ob ours. I's so

Welcome, little coz. (<i>shakes hands; then retraces steps to <span class="smcap">Mrs. D.'s</span>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> I came here in search of my husband.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> Your husband?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> Yes. You know father was bitterly opposed to our
union, and after George found out that he had disinherited me for
marrying against his wishes, he began to gamble and drink heavily.
He swore to be revenged upon every member of our family.
Oh, what days and nights of torture I was obliged to endure! Finally
one evening over two years ago he left me without a word of
warning.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> Why did you not inform us of his actions? We surely
could have been of assistance to you.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> I preferred bearing my sorrow and disgrace alone; besides
I needed no assistance, for the dowry settled upon me by my
father when he closed his doors upon me, was ample to support
Nellie and myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> Still, by our sympathy we might have alleviated your
sufferings, which must have been intense.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> They were&mdash;words fail to describe them. If I had
been anything but a loving faithful wife they would not have been
so hard to bear. (<i>weeps</i>)</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> (<i>consolingly</i>) There, never mind. I hope there are
brighter days in store for you. Are you aware that your father is
in town?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> (<i>alarmed</i>) No. For mercy's sake don't let him see me.
It would kill me in my present condition to meet his gaze now, after
the fulfilment of his prophecy in regard to George.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> I believe he never met your husband, did he?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> No, we were married away from home. But he <i>knew</i>
him by reputation, and warned me against him. None of my relatives
ever met him. Where is my father?</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> At Auntie Thornton's. He came on to attend Helen's
wedding. But have no fear of seeing him, you are safe here.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> (<i>looking around room</i>) But, George, what are you doing
here? I thought you made Auntie's house your home.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> (<i>confused</i>) Yes&mdash;I did once&mdash;but&mdash; Some other time I'll
tell you my story. It would only distress you to hear it now. Tell
me more about your husband. Have you never met or heard anything
about him since he left you?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> Not until this evening.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> (<i>surprised</i>) This evening! Why, what do you mean?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> That I both met him and heard him to-night!</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> Where did you meet him?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> On the street.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> Impossible! For I know every creature in this town.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> Perhaps you do not know him by his right name. If you
know every creature in this town, tell me if you ever (<i>takes photograph
from pocket and hands it to <span class="smcap">Graef</span></i>) met a man who resembled
that? He is my husband.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> (<i>takes photo; starts</i>) What! he your husband?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> He is. You know him then?</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> Yes, alas, too well!</p>

<p><b>Pete.</b> Massa George, yo' sartinly will hab to 'scuse me now, fo'
I must be goin'. I hab a 'pintment wid Billy de Deacon's boy.
I'se gwine to hab more fun wid him to-night dan a bushel basket

<p><b>Graef.</b> Very well; don't forget <i>my</i> appointment. But wait a
moment. (<i>walks across to him and hands him photo.</i>) Do you know
who that is?</p>

<p><b>Pete.</b> (<i>laughs</i>) Yo' jest bet I does. But won't he look different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>

<i><span class="smcap">Graef</span> crosses over to <span class="smcap">Mrs. D.'s</span> side</i>)</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> What did you mean a moment ago when you said you
knew my husband "too well?"</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> I cannot tell you now, the story is too long. How long
do you intend to remain with us?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> I return home in the morning.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> (<i>quickly</i>) No, no; you must not. You <i>shall</i> not.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> (<i>surprised</i>) Why not?</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> For several reasons. First you must hear <i>my</i> story in
the morning. Then learn how well your husband is trying to keep
his oath in regard to injuring your relatives, and, lastly, you may
be needed as a witness against him. You are safe in this house
and no one will know of your presence.</p>

<p><b>Mrs. D.</b> Why, what has he done?</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> You shall hear in the morning. Sufficient is it for you to
know he's the blackest-hearted villain that ever went unhung.
Come, let us find the landlady and see about lodgings for you.

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Yes, if you possess it.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> (<i>taking watch charm from pocket</i>) Do you recognize
that charm?</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> Aunt, this charm and note were found by Pete just outside
of your dressing-room door the morning after the robbery.
He, thinking they might lead to a clue, brought them to me. From
the contents of this note I learned who committed the theft and
where the diamonds were secreted.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> With pleasure. (<i>walks to <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>, unfolds note and

the place where the diamonds were hidden, and brought them to
me. I will give them to you in a moment. Are you through? (<i>to
<span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>. Takes small package from pocket and hands it to
<span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span></i>) There they are.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> Mrs. Thornton, that note is supposed to be written by
me. In it I am made to state the <i>hour</i> I was to commit the robbery,
and the <i>place</i> where I would hide the diamonds, so that my
confederate could find them. Now, do you think if <i>I</i> planned the
affair and had an accomplice, I would be likely to write him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
tell-tale note, and allow it to fall into an interested party's hands
to be used against me?</p>

<p><b>Pete.</b> Did yo' eber hear de like?</p>

<p><b>Mrs. T.</b> Well, hardly, but how do you account for the note explaining
where the diamonds were hidden?</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> That's plain enough to me. There stands the man (<i>looking
at <span class="smcap">Graef</span></i>) who <i>took</i> the diamonds; there stands the man who
<i>returned</i> them, and <i>there</i> is the man who wrote that note and trumped
up this charge to shield himself at my expense.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> You infamous scoundrel! (<i>advances upon <span class="smcap">Wheeler</span></i>)</p>

<p><b>Pete.</b> (<i>excitedly</i>) Pin him, Massa George. I'd nebber stand dat,
suah!</p>

<p><b>Mrs. T.</b> (<i>looks reproachfully at <span class="smcap">Graef</span></i>) Can it be possible!</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> Aunt, for heaven's sake, believe not that black-hearted
villain. In one moment I'll convince you of his guilt beyond
question. This morning, Davis the pawnbroker, came to my room
of his own free will, and told me that that man (<i>pointing to
<span class="smcap">Wheeler</span></i>) was the one who left one of your jewels at his shop,
and that he was to pay Davis three hundred dollars to keep that
fact a secret. Is that sufficient for you?</p>

<p><b>Pete.</b> (<i>aside</i>) Ob his own free will, did he? I guess I skeered
ole Davis nigh about to deff. I tole him we knew who gave
him dat diamond an' I was on my way to git an officer to 'rest
him as a 'complice.</p>

<p><b>Wheeler.</b> The lying scoundrel! I'll get even with him for that,
and with <i>you</i> (<i>to <span class="smcap">Graef</span></i>) and you, (<i>to <span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span></i>) and with all of
you.</p>

have been that <i>fiend's</i> motive in trying to bring disgrace upon us
all, baffles my comprehension.</p>

<p><b>Graef.</b> His desire to be revenged upon Minnie and all her relatives,

her for marrying contrary to his wishes, has been the motive that
actuated him. (<i><span class="smcap">Parson</span>, <span class="smcap">Miss Amelia</span> and <span class="smcap">Deacon</span> cross to

second walking gentleman, two light comedians (lawyer and foreign adventurer),
Dutch and Irish character comedians, villain, soldiers; leading juvenile lady, walking

<p class="center"><i>A Practical Guide for Amateur Actors.</i></p>

<p class="center large">PRICE, 25 CENTS.</p>

<p>This work, without a rival in the field of dramatic literature, covers the entire subject
of amateur acting, and answers the thousand and one questions that arise constantly
to worry and perplex both actor and manager. It tells how to select plays and what
plays to select; how to get up a dramatic club&mdash;whom to choose and whom to avoid;
how to select characters, showing who should assume particular <i>rôles</i>; how to rehearse
a play properly&mdash;including stage business, by-play, voice, gestures, action, etc.; how to
represent all the passions and emotions, from Love to Hate (this chapter is worth many
times the price of the book, as the same information cannot be found in any similar
work); how to costume modern plays. All is told in such a plain, simple style that
the veriest tyro can understand. The details are so complete and the descriptions so
clear that the most inexperienced can follow them readily. The book is full of breezy
anecdotes that illustrate different points. But its crowning merit is that it is thoroughly
<span class="allsc">PRACTICAL</span>&mdash;it is the result of the author's long experience as an actor and manager.
Every dramatic club in the land should possess a copy of this book, and no actor can
afford to be without it. It contains so much valuable information that even old stagers
will consult it with advantage.</p>
